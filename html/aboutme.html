   <p>
      I am currently in the Computer Software Development program.
      I am learning the basics of buidling websites.
      It' been exciting to understand how to build the structure 
      and design of a website. I never realized how much thought goes into the layout,
      structure, and even the smallest design details of a webpage.
      Every new tag or property I learn feels like unlocking a new piece of a
      puzzle.This process is helping me not only build technical skills
      but also develop a more creative and logical approach to problem-solving.

      My dog's name is Coco. She loves going on walks and sniffing everthing in sight.
      She's full of energy and always keeps me on my toes.

    <p>
      Whenever I get the chance, I love to travel and explore new places.
      This photo was taken at the top of the Highway to Heaven hike in Hawaii,
      an unforgetable view that made every step worth it.
